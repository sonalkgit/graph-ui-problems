# 🌐 Graph Crafter Hackathon: Visualize the Knowledge  

Welcome to **Graph Crafter**, a frontend-focused hackathon hosted by **ZySec AI**. Your challenge is to build a powerful, elegant, and interactive **Graph UI** from structured JSON data — similar to tools like Neo4j, Memgraph, or network visualizations used in security, compliance, and knowledge management.

---

## 📘 Background  

Graphs are everywhere — from policy engines and user access systems to social networks and LLM knowledge graphs. But visualizing them clearly and interactively is a hard UI/UX problem.  

This hackathon challenges you to build a **modern, reactive, and insightful Graph UI** that reads a JSON representation of nodes and edges, and turns it into an interactive visualization.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement  

> Build a web-based **Graph UI** that reads a structured JSON file describing nodes, edges, metadata, and styling — and renders it into an interactive, pannable, zoomable, and understandable graph.

Your UI must:
- Visualize labeled nodes and edges  
- Support directional edges and metadata tooltips  
- Respect styles (e.g., shape, color, dashed lines)  
- Allow node/edge interactions (hover/click)  
- Be responsive and user-friendly  

---

## 📦 JSON Input Format  

The UI must accept input like this:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "user_1",
      "label": "Alice",
      "type": "Person",
      "properties": {
        "email": "alice@example.com",
        "role": "Analyst"
      },
      "style": {
        "color": "#4CAF50",
        "shape": "circle"
      },
      "group": "Team A"
    },
    {
      "id": "doc_1",
      "label": "Report Q1",
      "type": "Document",
      "properties": {
        "created": "2024-03-01",
        "status": "approved"
      },
      "style": {
        "color": "#2196F3",
        "shape": "rectangle"
      },
      "group": "Documents"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "user_1",
      "target": "doc_1",
      "label": "authored",
      "direction": "one-way",
      "style": {
        "dashed": false,
        "color": "#555"
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "title": "Knowledge Graph - Access Control",
    "description": "Sample graph representing users, documents, and policies."
  }
}
```
